This is a metalness workflow PBR renderer. More thought was put into the theory than the implementation but it runs quite fast on my system.

This project was developed locally, so the assets used to test the engine are not optimized for delivery over the web. Some assets may load slowly. In the future I may make a demo with lighter assets for faster loading. The actual engine works fine, however.

The assets are high resolution PBR textures and models from Texture Haven and CG Trader.

The demo uses traditional first person camera controls (WASD + Mouse-look) and a debug toggle key (N) to switch between PBR rendering and viewing texture normal maps.

It was tested on Firefox in Manjaro Linux. Some browsers may not support WebGL2 properly. If the models don't load (coffee cart, knight, and material spheres), there is a video demo at my [website](https://hannesojala.github.io/).
