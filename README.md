[Live](https://hannesojala.github.io/webgl-pbr)  
A metalness workflow PBR renderer, designed as a learning project for low level web graphics technology.

This project was developed locally, so the assets used to test the engine are not optimized for delivery over the web. Some assets may load slowly. In the future I may make a demo with lighter assets for faster loading. The actual engine works fine, however.

Controls: WASD + Mouse-look, debug toggle key (N) to switch between PBR rendering and viewing texture normal maps.

Tested on Firefox in Manjaro Linux. Some browsers may not support WebGL2 properly, or you may have to enable it yourself in the settings. If the models don't load (coffee cart, knight, and material spheres), there is a video demo at my [website](https://hannesojala.github.io/).
